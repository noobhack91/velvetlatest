voluntarily grant your informed consent to Velvet Klub to deal with your personal information in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
You can retract your consent by contacting us at admin@velvetklub.com as soon as possible. If
you retract your consent, you acknowledge and agree that failure to provide certain types of
personal information may not give you access to the full functionality of the Site.
Information we collect from you From time to time, we may collect your contact information (such as your email address). </p>
<p>
You may also supply us with your personal information if you register for any paid services or if you
use the contact form on the Site.
Occasionally, we may conduct surveys or market research and in doing so, we may seek other
information from you. This will provide us with information that allows us to improve the type and
quality of Site and any services offered to you, and the manner in which the Site and services are
offered to you.
We may also request personal information from you in order to supply you with our paid services
(for GST purposes).

<h2>Cookies</h2>

you revisit the Site. A cookie does not identify you personally but it does identify your computer.
You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie and this will provide you with
an opportunity to either accept or reject it in each instance.</p>
 
<h2>Use of your personal information</h2>
<h3>Unless you object, your personal information may be used to:</h3>

send news, information about our activities and general promotional material which we
believe may be useful to you;
monitor who is accessing the Site or using services offered on the Site;
profile the type of people accessing the Site;
ensure the proper functioning of the Site; and
assist us with our marketing, planning, development and research requirements.
If you request us not to use personal information in a particular manner or at all, we will adopt all
reasonable measures to observe your request but we may still use or disclose that information if
we:
subsequently notify you of the intended use or disclosure and you do not object to that
use or disclosure;
believe that the use or disclosure is reasonably necessary to assist a law enforcement
agency or an agency responsible for government or public scrutiny in the performance of
their functions; or

Disclosure of your personal information
We may disclose personal information to our service providers who assist us in operating the
Site. We will only disclose personal information to a third party unrelated to Velvet Klub with your
consent.
Apart from such circumstances, we may disclose personal information in special situations where
we have reason to believe that doing so is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action
against anyone damaging, injuring or interfering (intentionally or unintentionally) with our rights or
property, users or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities.
We may also disclose personal information as required by law.
In the event that we sell or buy businesses or their assets, or engage in transfers, acquisitions,
mergers, restructurings, changes of control and other similar transactions, customer information
is generally one of the transferable business assets. Thus, your personal information may be
subject to such a transfer. In the unlikely event of insolvency, personal information may be
transferred to a trustee or debtor in possession and then to a subsequent purchaser.
If you voluntarily provide information in publicly accessible areas of the Site, the information can
be viewed and therefore used by others. We advise users not to disclose contact information that
they do not wish to have publicly available. We are not responsible for personal information you
choose to submit publicly.</p>

your obligation that you protect yourself against unauthorised access to your password and to
your computer. Please log out of the Site when you have finished using a shared computer. Be
wary of including sensitive information in your emails to us as they are not necessarily secure
against interception. We will not ask for passwords in an email and you should assume that if you
get such a request, it must be fraudulent.
</p>
<p>
We have processes in place to ensure the security of your personal information. We have
procedures to help safeguard and prevent unauthorised access, maintain data security, and
correctly use your information. However, neither people nor security systems are infallible,including encryption systems. While we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal
information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

<p>
We have obligations under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) to notify you if you are affected by an
eligible data breach. We will take all reasonable precautions to take remedial action to prevent
such an event. As we cannot guarantee that remedial action will be sufficient to prevent all
instances of a breach, we will take steps to notify you of an eligible data breach as soon as
practicable and provide recommendations as to what steps you should take to mitigate any
serious loss or damage.</p>

circumstances. If you would like to obtain such access, please contact us on the details set out
above.</p>

alongside and do not replace other informal or legal procedures by which an individual can be
provided access to, or correction of, their personal information, including the requirements under
the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth).</p>
