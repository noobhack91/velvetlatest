these Terms are excluded. Where legislation implies any condition or warranty, and that legislation
prohibits us from excluding or modifying the application of, or our liability under, any such condition
or warranty, that condition or warranty will be deemed included. However, Velvet klub’ liability will
be limited to the terms of our Replacement and Refund Policy.</p>

Terms shall nevertheless continue in full force.</p>

<p>These Terms and the documents expressly referred to in them, constitute the entire agreement
