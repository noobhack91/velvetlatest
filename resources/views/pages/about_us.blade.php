				<p>We offer a practical, regularly updated search engine to help you locate the closest erotic service provider.</p>

				<p>By location and service type, velvetklub.com has created a helpful online tool for locating the closest escorts, erotic massage (relaxation), and BDSM Mistresses. The original result can then, if desired, be sorted by name, age, price, distance, independent, agency, parlor or brothel, incalls, and outcalls, or by any other criteria you want. In Australia, you can search for nearby High-Class Escorts, Call Girls, Female, Male, and Transgender sex workers, as well as those who work in brothels, escort agencies, and parlors. including towns and Regional Centers all around Australia.</p>


				<p>Just to keep the listing inside the law. Additionally, we call each advertiser to confirm them.</p>

				<p>When a profile sends us a verification photo that our admin team may fairly determine to be a match, we display "Verified Photos" on that profile. Advertisers still switch phones when someone is ill, on vacation, or even worse, retired! So, although there is a report user link accessible, we prefer that you utilize the contact us link below to alert our admin team of any bait and switch tactics.</p>



				<p>Just because some of the others haven't joined the program yet doesn't indicate the others are all fraudulent. And some are simply advertisements with a likeness-type image for reasons of anonymity.</p>

				<p>Your opinions are also necessary. To report any problems, please get in touch with</p>









			</div>





			<div id="tab2Content" style="display:none;" class="col-sm-8">

				<p><b>1. Thesewomen are they real?</b></p>
				<p>Actually, neither do any other escort websites. In a commercial for escort, prostitution, or sex work, hardly any advertising would use their real name. Most have names they made up. Not Facebook, this.</p>

				<p>We do recommend using actual, verifiable photos for each profile. You can rest assured that they are the ones scheduling the appointment. If this is not the case, any "photos verified" profiles should be reported to admin@gmail.com. The "photos verified" badge will be removed from profiles that are determined to be switching the person conducting the business.</p>

				<p>Since these girls are not willing to post their genuine images online, unverified profiles may be honest enough. They therefore employ likeness pictures. Finding a similar girl to the pictures when you meet is more hit-and-miss, so this is more for the seasoned gambler. Look at the price; at less than $ an hour, you get what you pay for. But not necessary if we haven't authenticated the images of that girl. It affects the entire industry.</p>


				<p>Remember that anyone may look good in glamor photographs.</p>

				<p>In case any misleading advertisements do get through, we also rely on input from the users.</p>

				<p>We take an effort to only retain current, legitimate advertising without any BS.</p>


				<p><b>2. I keep calling, but they never pick up?</b></p>
				<p>Most private or independent High Class escorts, call girls, sex workers, prostitutes, hookers, and erotic massage girls—referred to on this site for legal reasons as erotic relaxation—find it difficult to take calls while they are working. To your client, it would be impolite! Furthermore, unless they operate in a registered brothel, it is prohibited for anyone else to answer the phone or take reservations on their behalf in Queensland and certain other States. Make more calls. The good ones are typically challenging to reach, so good luck!</p>



				<p><b>3. Can I ask an advertiser to have sex with me bare back (i.e. without a condom) if I'm clean and healthy?</b></p>


				<p>Without a condom, I might add, sex acts are lawful in some areas but at your own risk. For instance, Sex Workers in NSW are allowed to engage in oral sex without the use of a condom or (bare back) if they so wish. In some areas, like as QLD, it is against the law to even inquire about a Queensland Sex Worker's willingness to provide any uncovered sexual services.</p>


				<p><b>4. Is prostitution illegal in Australia?</b></p>

				<p>No, depending on where the sex activities were planned and took place, prostitution is lawful in all Australian States and Territories. Most states, with the exception of Victoria, allow sex workers to operate out of their homes so long as no one complains to the local council. There are legal brothels in Queensland, NSW, and Victoria. Only in NSW, VIC, NT, and WA are Escort Agencies permitted.</p>

				<p><b>5. Why is this website there?</b></p>
				<p>To assist Australians (often referred to as "punters") in finding escorts, hookers, and rub & tug girls and males.</p>

				<p>This website will list the local escorts, call girls, and prostitutes (sometimes referred to as hookers by themselves, but don't call them that!) and erotic massage (the sort with a good ending! ), which will henceforth be referred to as "erotic relaxation" on our website per the PLA's Queensland requirements. If they are independent, employed by a brothel or escort service.</p>

				<p>Advertising regulations in Queensland and Victoria prohibit sex workers and brothels from outlining their specific services! These state enforcers of prostitution frequently put them to the test while pretending to be real gamblers! Therefore, don't be shocked if you still have trouble getting a lot of information over the phone.</p>


				<p>Good Luck</p>

				<p><b>6. Why am I unable to see the specifics of the services that some advertisers will provide?</b></p>
				<p>Various state laws have varying requirements for service descriptions. For instance, it is acceptable for an advertising to say that they will perform anal or bare back blow jobs (BBBJ) in NSW, but it is prohibited to say anything about any services in QLD.</p>

				<p><b>7. Why do advertisements in some states feature nudity and revealing images while those in other states have fairly dull images?</b></p>
				<p>Revealing images are prohibited by law in some states. For instance, in Victoria, sex workers are only allowed to take head and shoulder photographs, while in NSW, they are free to display nudity as they like.</p>
			</div>


			<div id="tab3Content" style="display:none;" class="col-sm-8">

				<p><b>1. Why was my advertising text rejected?</b></p>
				<p>What can and cannot be marketed with adult services is governed by various regulations in various states. For this reason, before any advertisements are seen to the general public, they are all moderated. In some States, like New South Wales, you are allowed to describe services, but not in others, like Queensland. Your advertisement can be rejected for some states if you include phrases like "cunt," "cum," etc. If you're advertising in Queensland, please review the PLA regulations.</p>

				<p><b>2. Why do some of my photographs occasionally not show up?</b></p>
				<p>Different photos may be displayed depending on the user's location and the regulations of the state from which they are searching. For instance, if you upload photographs that are fully nudified, users searching in NSW would see them, but users searching in QLD won't. Every photograph you post to your profile is reviewed for each state where it is legal to show that kind of picture.</p>

				<h1> <b>Terms and Definitions</b> </h1> <br>

				<h4><b>"Available Now" label</b></h4>
				<p>Your profile is marked with "Available Now" markings, which places you on the location's carousel. This is a fantastic method to let site visitors know that you are, well, available right this second! For 30 minutes, your profile will be shown on that location's carousel.
					All marketers may purchase "Available Now" credits for $3 each.</p>

				<h4><b>"Pop Out" profiles</b></h4>
				<p>Profiles of individuals that have been momentarily popped out of their organization/container container profile are known as "Pop Out" profiles. In the Velvet klub results pages, a "pop out" profile becomes searchable and will stand out above the weekly advertisements by location.</p>


				<p>"Pop Outs" for the Featured Agency and Establishment cost each $60 for a 4-week period.</p>
				<p>For an additional $85 per profile, you can feature these profiles. When the primary profile expires, all pop-out profiles are removed.</p>


				<p>To make the most of the advertising space you have purchased, different profiles can be shifted in and out of the primary business profile.</p>

				<h4><b>Agency/Brothel profile</b></h4>
				<p>Each Agency and Establishment profile has information specific to that profile that is targeted to the business. Up to 12 "Contained Individuals" profiles—their own Velvet Klub profile pages that can be "Popped Out" to make them searchable—can be included in both Featured Agencies and Establishment major advertisements. </p>

				<p>Individuals can be created under a single login, allowing you to showcase your best qualities and add more profile information and gallery photographs. To assist you in acquiring new clients, these People are additionally connected back to the main profile.</p>

				<p><b>Base locations</b></p>
				<p>In your State or Territory, base locations are permanent places. The criteria for showing your advertisement in the results page and the carousel include these places, which are utilized in site searches.</p>

				<p>A location can be made active or inactive, saving additional pricing and rate information for later use. Within that state, you can add another location after deactivating one.</p>

				<p>Try the Touring Option for Verified Advertisers if you're merely traveling away for a few weeks or less.
				</p>


				<h4><b>Boosting</b></h4>
				<p>Boosting is the process of manually placing your advertisement in the first position of our carousel at the time and date of your choosing in the places you choose. Boost credits can be purchased for $30 apiece from featured marketers. Boost credits left unused never expire. However, in order to use them, your Featured subscription must be active.
				</p>


				<h4><b>Photo Verification label</b></h4>
				<p>We advise you to have your "Photos Verified" by us if you want to make the most of your advertising. A legitimate profile will be indicated to the public by the "Photos Verified" mark.</p>
				<p>Only if they are accurate representations of you as the person providing the service is this possible.</p>

				<p>You'll need seven gallery images, two selfies that include your username as identification, and one last selfie that includes admin instructions. These can be emailed to Kristy's phone number 0450 733 525 or submitted to the website like other images. Unless you consent, these images will not be added to your public gallery.</p>

				<h4><b>Please Note:</b></h4>


				<div style="margin-left: 30px;">

					<li>The "Photos Verified" label will be removed if you add even one fraudulent image to your gallery of images until the fake image is deleted.</li>
					<li>Sending someone else to a booking without giving them advance notice—other than the individual who was advertised—will result in the "Photos <p>Verified" badge being removed.</p>
					</li>
					<li>Reverse image searches are popular, and the public is eager to correct us when we're in error.</li>


				</div>


				<h4><b>The Carousel</b></h4>
				<p>Our main place for advertising is the Carousel. The revolving carousel at the top of each search page will show the nearby most recent Featured advertisers. You may reach the most customers by being included in our carousel! If you want extra time in the carousel for your places, you can buy boost credits.</p>

				<h4><b>Touring locations</b></h4>
				<p>When you specify a location for a tour, you also define a from/to date that tells viewers when to anticipate you there. Up to 5 touring destinations can be put up (For Verified users only) and can be used up to 4 weeks in advance. They will automatically post when you arrive and hide when you depart.</p>
